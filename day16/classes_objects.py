# Let in a restro a waiter is responsible for particular tables and holding a plate as:
is_holding_plate = True
tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6] 

# Here waiter is an object while the above two variables are considered to be attributes and the ones mentioned below are methods
def take_order(table, order):
	#takes order to the chef

def take_payment(amount):
	#add money to the restaurant

# waiter's a real life object and in OOP these blueprints are called class.
	#if we divide the class waiter into two individual objects like henry and betty then these are called objects.
# things they have: attributes(variables)
# things they can do: methods(functions)

# a class is usually written with first letter capilalised and words instead of being separated with another capital letter.

# if a class CarBlueprint() can define a car with all the features then car = CarBlueprint(where car is an object) can be used to 
# duplicate the blueprint for the car.
